# Wordle-Spanish

## Overview
Wordle-Spanish is a Java-based implementation of the popular word game Wordle, adapted for the Spanish language. This project includes both the game logic and a user interface.

## Development Background
This project was developed during my first year of studying software development. It served as a learning experience and a platform to apply fundamental concepts in a practical setting. It's important to note that the code and design patterns used in this project might not reflect my current coding skills or style, as they have evolved significantly since this project's inception.

## Structure
The project is divided into two main components:
- **Controlador (Controller):** Contains the game's control logic.
- **Vista (View):** Manages the user interface and interactions.

## Getting Started
To run this project, you will need a Java development environment. The project is set up for the Eclipse IDE, but it can be adapted for use in other environments as well.

1. Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/Sultavespa/Wordle-Spanish-.git
2. Open the project in Eclipse or your preferred IDE.
3. Run the `Main.java` file to start the game.

## Contributions
As this project was a part of my learning journey, I am not actively seeking contributions. However, feel free to fork the repository and experiment with your own versions of the game.
